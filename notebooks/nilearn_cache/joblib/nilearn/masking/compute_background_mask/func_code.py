    """ Compute a brain mask for the images by guessing the value of the
    background from the border of the image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_imgs: Niimg-like object
        See http://nilearn.github.io/manipulating_images/input_output.html
        Images used to compute the mask. 3D and 4D images are accepted.
        If a 3D image is given, we suggest to use the mean image

    border_size: integer, optional
        The size, in voxel of the border used on the side of the image
        to determine the value of the background.

    connected: bool, optional
        if connected is True, only the largest connect component is kept.

    opening: bool or int, optional
        if opening is True, a morphological opening is performed, to keep
        only large structures. This step is useful to remove parts of
        the skull that might have been included.
        If opening is an integer `n`, it is performed via `n` erosions.
        After estimation of the largest connected constituent, 2`n` closing
        operations are performed followed by `n` erosions. This corresponds
        to 1 opening operation of order `n` followed by a closing operator
        of order `n`.

    target_affine: 3x3 or 4x4 matrix, optional
        This parameter is passed to image.resample_img. Please see the
        related documentation for details.

    target_shape: 3-tuple of integers, optional
        This parameter is passed to image.resample_img. Please see the
        related documentation for details.

    memory: instance of joblib.Memory or string
        Used to cache the function call.

    verbose: int, optional

    Returns
    -------
    mask: nibabel.Nifti1Image
        The brain mask (3D image)
